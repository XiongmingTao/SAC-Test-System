# SAC-Test-System
The specific configurations of the five test systems for the SAC mechanism and their corresponding sharding schemes.

The approach is applied to numerical simulations on 24 bus, 66 bus, 109 bus, 151 bus, and 179 bus systems, which are extended from the original IEEE test systems. Details of the files are provided below.
